      <title>Stein&#39;s Method in ML: Theory and Applications</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exploring avenues such as Amortized MCMC, Functional KL Minimization for Nonparametric Models, and optimization in Natural Parameter Space where employing Stein’s Method for Variational Inference or Gradient Estimation may lead to improvements. I am currently surveying the literature of Stein Gradient Estimators, Amortized MCMC Algorithms, and state of the art Natural Gradient and “Inference via Weight Perturbation” methods such as K-FAC and its variants, VADAM and VProp&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An investigation into algorithms for functional optimization in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces and the problem of scaling kernel learning and nonparametric function approximation to streaming data. I am currently surveying the literature on Online Kernel Learning and Nonparametric Stochastic Optimization&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Probabilistic Models for Joint Image and Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://aniket1998.github.io/project/3wacv/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Worked on developing a hierarchical model that first generates a summary frame for the video, and then models individual frames by adding to the summary frame&amp;rsquo;s latent code, sequentially dependent residual vectors conditioned on the summary frame. Further extended this idea to video generation models that disentangle content from dynamics, by adding to the base content representation, a residual vector at each timestep conditioned on the base content vector and the dynamics of the given timestep. We achieved significant improvements over the respective baselines for both video and image generation and the work is currently submitted to the Winter Conference on the Applications of Computer Vision 2020 (WACV 2020)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Computational Models for Human Inference of Social Situations</title>
      <link>https://aniket1998.github.io/project/4nsriv/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 May 2018 02:25:14 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aniket1998.github.io/project/4nsriv/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aimed to characterize the nature and granularity of information about social interactions accessible to human observers from simple visual displays. Studied lay theories of human emotion modelling and developed a computational model for social situations involving few agents, based on the Valence Arousal Model of emotion detection and the Social Force Model for Pedestrian Dynamics&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Attention Based Models for Image Captioning and Generation</title>
      <link>https://aniket1998.github.io/project/5pclub/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 02:25:19 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aniket1998.github.io/project/5pclub/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Studied the theory of encoder decoder sequence models, soft attention and hard attention and reproduced the results in &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Show Attend and Tell : Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Case Studies : A Legal Consultant Bot</title>
      <link>https://aniket1998.github.io/project/6cfd/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Dec 2017 02:25:24 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aniket1998.github.io/project/6cfd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developed a legal consultant bot that summarises a legal document, highlights the key phrases and answers some rudimentary questions about the document as part of the Microsoft code.fun.do Hackathon on AI and NLP. Created a custom dataset by scrapinng from an archive of Indian legal documents, and Used TextRank Algorithm on the large text corpora and Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modelling. Selected as one of the top 3 ideas on campus by Microsoft Judges&lt;/p&gt;
